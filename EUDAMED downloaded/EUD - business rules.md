| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BR-UDID-001 : Registration of new Devices | RESOLVED | Users associated to Manufacturer Actors will be able to enter (to register) new Devices in MDR EUDAMED for all Applicable legislation`s - Regulation Devices having applicable legislation : MDR, IVDR and Legacy devices having Applicable legislation: MDD,AIMDD or IVDD. |  |
| BR-UDID-003: Uniqueness of DI Codes and format structure | RESOLVED | A Device Identifier Code (DI Code) consists of the couple formed by the Issuing Entity who is issuing that code and the Code itself (uniqueness checks for DI Codes take into account both Issuing Entity and the Code). BASIC UDI- DI, Master UDI-DI, Secondary DI, Package level DI, EUDAMED DI codes must be unique in the system. The codes can be referenced only once inside the system. UDI-DI Codes must be unique in the system but the same code can be referenced by one Regulation Device and by one Legacy Device at the same time as a UDI-DI (both a Regulation and a Legacy Device can have the same UDI-DI code at a time), and several times as a Direct Marking DI code. Direct Marking DI code must be unique in the system but can be referenced by several Devices. A Direct Marking code can be referenced by several devices as a Direct Marking DI and can be also referenced as UDI-DI. Unit of Use DI code must be unique in the system but can be referenced by several Devices as a Unit of Use DI(same Unit of Use DI can be referenced by several UDI-DIs) The format of the Basic UDI-DI structure will be checked against the format structure provided by the Issuing Entities The format of the (Master) UDI-DI code, Secondary DI Code, Unit of Use Code, Direct marking DI Code, Container Package DI Code structure will be checked against the format structure provided by the Issuing Entity when the selected issuing Entity is GS1. Notes: When mentioning that a Code must be unique in the system, means that it can be provided only once inside the system; (they can be afterwards reused several times as mentioned per each type of Device identifier apart); The reusability of the Device identifier (referencing the same Device identifier for several Devices) is applicable only for Devices / System or procedure Packs of the same Manufacturer/ Producer (System or Procedure Pack Producer ); |  |
